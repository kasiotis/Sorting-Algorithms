# Sorting-Algorithms Project

This was an Undergraduate project that I worked on where I was tasked with implementing and comparing Sorting Algorithms. The algorithms were implemented by using their pseudo-code.
The algorithms that were implemented and tested include, Insertion Sort, Quicksort and an unkown algorithm labeled as "NewSort".
